Task Nr.2:
Create a command-line task manager application using Python and MongoDB. The application should allow
users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks stored in a MongoDB database.
Users should be able to add new tasks, view all tasks, update task status, and delete tasks.

Requirements:

The application should utilize the PyMongo library for interacting with the MongoDB database.
Users should be able to perform the following actions: - Add a new task with a title and description. 
    - View all tasks with their details.
    - Update the status of a task (e.g., mark as completed or in progress).
    - Delete a task.
Implement error handling and validation for user inputs.
Use appropriate functions and modular code structure for better code organization.
Include a README file with clear instructions on how to set up and run the application.
