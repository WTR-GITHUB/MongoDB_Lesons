Create an income tax calculator: 
 + Generate at least 500 documents , with fields: name, surname, date of birth , age (determined from date of birth), anual salary before tax (EUR, round to 2 numbers after comma)
 - Create a CLI application that would let us get first 10 people from database within the age bracket [min_age, max_age]
 - Those people name surname and age should be shown as an option to choose.
 - When one of ten options is chosen, there should be calculated tax return (it should be created a document as a tax card, values taken from database). Lets say GPM tax is 20% and HealtTax is 15% from 90% of the income left after GPM deduction.
 - The final values should be show and wrriten to database (like a generated data and taxes paid, take home pay etc.) and portrayed in a web page (use flask and docker, show the url were to click )
